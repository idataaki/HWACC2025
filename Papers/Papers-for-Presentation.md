# Hardware Accelerators Course

## Overview
This course is designed to introduce students to **cutting-edge research in hardware acceleration and computer architecture**. A key component of the course involves student presentations based on papers from **top-tier conferences**, including:

- **HPCA (High-Performance Computer Architecture)**
- **MICRO (International Symposium on Microarchitecture)**
- **ISCA (International Symposium on Computer Architecture)**

These conferences publish groundbreaking research in **processor design, memory systems, parallel computing, and specialized hardware accelerators**, making them highly relevant for students in this course. Papers accepted at these venues undergo a rigorous peer-review process, ensuring students engage with high-quality and impactful research.

## Student Presentations
Each student is required to **select a research paper**, conduct a **thorough analysis**, and deliver a **25-minute presentation** to the class. This exercise helps students develop critical thinking, technical analysis, and effective communication skills.

## Review Process
To create an interactive and engaging learning environment, each presentation is evaluated by **three referees**:

1. **The professor** – Provides expert insights and ensures key technical aspects are covered.
2. **A teaching assistant (TA)** – Assesses technical depth, clarity, and completeness.
3. **A student peer** – Challenges the presenter, raises thought-provoking questions, and offers a fresh perspective.

## Goals of the Review Process
- **Encouraging Active Participation**: The referees challenge the presenter, fostering lively discussions and debates.
- **Developing Critical Thinking**: The class collectively **analyzes the strengths and weaknesses** of the paper, encouraging students to assess research quality beyond just understanding the content.
- **Broadening Perspectives**: Students gain exposure to diverse ideas, alternative approaches, and **real-world implications of hardware accelerator designs**.

## Learning Outcomes
By engaging with **state-of-the-art research**, students will:
- Enhance their ability to **critically evaluate technical papers**.
- Improve their **presentation and communication skills**.
- Gain valuable insights into the **latest advancements in hardware accelerators and computer architecture**.

Through this process, students not only stay up to date with cutting-edge research but also **develop essential skills** for careers in academia and industry.
